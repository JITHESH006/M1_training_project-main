## Who
The installation of a hospital management system project delivers a number of benefits to the institution, including increased service quality and efficiency. As previously stated, it is built so that a user can manage the following: patient information, records, and management, as well as third-parties such as medicine suppliers and insurance organisations.

It reduces the requirement for these details to be obtained at each visit.
## When
HMS information system helps to track and control finances, reduce leakages as well as reduce manual work and therefore there is no requirement of the higher human workforce.

## Where
The Hospital Management System enables healthcare workers to review clinical documentation, diagnoses, patient data, and other pertinent information in a single perspective, allowing them to make timely choices.
## How
 The system creates an external file to store the data perminantly.This system is deployed using c programming.
